A journalist in India remembers Pakistani peace activist who brought home her late grandfather's ashes,"Karamat Sahib had this ability to make possible what was impossible with gentleness, humour and compassion","['Karamat Ali was many things but for me he was always the person who returned my grandfather Kuldip Nayar to the home he was born in. The relationship between him and my grandfather defies labels but it has a bond that is deep and unbreakable, stronger than many relationships with names.', 'There are many words for friendship. Arabic has twelve. You can choose from friendships of different shades — the intense saqeeb, a true friend; sameer, someone who you like to have a conversation with, or the casual zameel, an acquaintance.', 'English has just the one — a bland ""friend"". The short dost (friend) in Hindustani encompasses in its tiny frame a sort of bro-code for the intense relationship that Hindi film songs refer to, between Maana Dey’s Yaari hai Imaan (My friend is my faith) to Sholay’s anthem Yeh Dosti Hum Nahi (This friendship we will never abandon).', 'So I struggle to find a word to describe the relationship between Karamat Ali, labour leader, peace activist, revolutionary, lover of music, and my grandfather Kuldip Nayar, journalist, peace-activist and fellow dreamer. And by extension, my relationship with Karamat Sahib.', 'This relationship without a name has a bond that is deep and unbreakable, stronger than many relationships with names.', 'Karamat Ali was many things but for me he was always the person who returned my grandfather to the home he was born in.', '“He put my hand on my shoulder and told me that like Nirmala Didi, he too, wanted his ashes to be immersed on both sides,’’ said Karamat Sahib when I met him in Delhi in 2018. He was referring to Nirmala Deshpande, a Gandhian who spent her life advocating for peace. Karamat Sahib had scattered her ashes on the Indus too.', 'This was a few weeks after my grandfather had missed his annual visit to the Wagah border to light candles on the anniversary of Pakistan and India’s independence from the British in 1947. He had instead passed away in a hospital.', '“So, I will take him back,’’ Karamat told me.', 'It was just that simple. In 2008, Karamat Sahib had come to India and taken a part of what remained of Nirmala Didi with him back to Pakistan. There, he led a delegation that immersed the ashes of Nirmala Deshpande, Gandhian and peace activist, in the Indus near the Sadhu Bela temple at Sukkur in Sindh.', 'But by 2018 things were different. A great frost had settled in the relationship between the two countries from 2015 with no thaw. There were no visas for Pakistanis. Even letters even with the right stamp didn’t reach. Finding a way to send a tiny portion of my grandfather’s ashes across to Pakistan seemed like an impossibility.', 'Without knowing that my grandfather had expressed this wish, I had taken upon myself this wild task to avoid dealing with his passing.', 'Karamat Sahib had appeared, almost by magic on rare reprieve, as if this had been the purpose of his travel instead of attending a conference on fishermen.', 'We asked if he wanted us to drop the ashes to him in the morning – most people would not want to spend the night with ashes in their room. Karamat Sahib said he could use the company. He kept the urn with my grandfather’s ashes in his room for a night till he crossed back to Pakistan. I often think that they must have had a lot to catch up on.', 'My grandfather’s journey across Wagah is a story I have heard Karamat Sahib narrate many times. As I write, I can hear his raspy voice recount it to me, as he did when I joined him for the immersion of Kuldip Nayar’s ashes.', 'At the Wagah border crossing, he placed the urn on the desk of the immigration officer. When the officer asked him what was in the container and if he had permission, he replied: “Yeh Kuldip Nayar Sahib hain. Aapne watan waapis laut rahe hain. (This is Mr Kuldip Nayar. He is returning home). He doesn’t need a visa.’’', 'With that, he walked past the counter to the other side.', 'Karamat Sahib had this ability to make possible what was impossible — with gentleness, humour and compassion, and a smile that will be greatly missed.', 'He started young. Born in Multan in 1945, he was only 17 when he cut his teeth in student politics. It was 1962 and General Ayub Khan’s government had banned student unions. Students from Karachi including Mairaj Muhammed Khan and Syed Ali Mukhtar Rizvi, were expelled and turned to Multan for refuge.', 'Karamat Sahib led the students in a huge procession to the commissioner of Multan’s office and organised a sit-in there. The commissioner listened and allowed the expelled students to stay in Multan, giving Karamat Sahib his first taste of a win.', 'Twenty years later, he founded the Pakistan Institute of Labour Education and Research (Piler).', '“Back in those days, Piler was a dream for him, which he carried around in his briefcase,” said economist Kaiser Bengali at a meeting organised by the Arts Council of Pakistan in memory of Karamat Sahib this week.', '“When he was getting the funding to establish Piler, the people from the organisation who had brought the cheques said that they had an issue with the communist leaders he idolised, and instead of agreeing with them in order to take the money from them, he simply asked them to take their money back. He was honest and unwilling to part with his beliefs and principles,” said Dr Bengali.', 'His house was filled with books, he danced well and he wrote poetry. “But he never let the romantic side overpower his revolutionary side.

reserved seats in the assemblies.', ""The apex court reserved the verdict on the SIC’s appeals on Tuesday after conducting nine hearings on the SIC's appeals with all parties including the federal

seats to the ruling coalition comprising the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and others, allowed them securing a two-thirds majority in the National Assembly.',

based on the total number of seats it won as per the law."", 'The ECP and other political parties adopted a somewhat similar argument contending that the party is not eligible to get reserved seats as

the ""bat"" symbol for them.', ""However, the party's relief was shortlived as the Supreme Court just after three days annulled the PHC's order while upholding the electoral watchdog’s decision depriving the former ruling party of its 'iconic' symbol."", 'This led the PTI candidates to contest the February 8 polls as independents and later the party’s victorious candidates join the SIC in a

seeking to set aside the PHC verdict and the allocation of 67 women and 11 minority seats in the assemblies.', ""The allocation of reserved seats holds significance as the PTI-backed independent candidates, who make up the majority of the opposition benches, lost as many as 77 reserved seats in NA and provincial assemblies due to the PHC's verdict."", 'Now, the SC is set to announce the

Relentless rain, a phenomena scientists have also linked to a warmer planet, caused extensive flooding in Kenya, China, Brazil, Afghanistan, Russia and France.', 'Wildfires have torched land in Greece and Canada and last week, Hurricane Beryl became the earliest category five Atlantic hurricane on record as it barrelled across several Caribbean islands.', 'The streak of record-breaking temperatures coincided with El Nino, a natural phenomenon that contributes to hotter weather globally, said Julien Nicolas, a senior scientist at C3S.', '“That was part of the factors behind the temperature records, but it was not the only one,” he said. Ocean temperatures have also been hitting new highs.', 'Record sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic, the Northern Pacific and Indian Ocean also contributed to the soaring heat across the globe. Sea surface temperatures hit a separate milestone in June — 15 straight months of new highs, an occurrence Nicolas described as “striking”.', 'The oceans cover 70% of the Earth’s surface and absorb 90% of the extra heat associated with rising climate-warming emissions. “What happens to the ocean surface has an important impact on the air temperature above the surface and global average temperature as well,” he said.', 'However, the world is about to transition into a La Nina phase, which has a cooling effect. “We can expect the global (air) temperature to taper down in the next few months,” said Nicolas.', '“If these record (sea surface) temperatures persist, even as La Nina conditions develop that might lead to 2024 being warmer than 2023. But it’s too early to tell,” he added. Global air temperatures in the 12 months to June 2024 were the highest in the data record — on average 1.64C above pre-industrial levels, Copernicus said.']","July 09, 2024",https://www.geo.tv/latest/553418-june-2024-hottest-on-record-globally-beating-2023-high-eu-climate-monitor,World,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2024-07-09/553418_4507190_updates.jpg

Why exit poll is a critical indicator in UK's election process,"Historically, exit poll is released around 10 pm on election night, when voting closes","['The exit poll holds significant importance in the United Kingdom’s electoral process. It marks a key moment when an extensive analysis conducted by a think tank reveals the winning trend.', 'Normally, the exit poll is released around 10 pm on election night, when voting closes, lifting the media silence mandated by British broadcasting rules. This release provides abundant insights for the media to analyse.', 'Unlike other polls, the exit poll is funded by a consortium of BBC, Sky News, and ITV. The data is collected by Ipsos and studied by experts in a central London location.', 'Ipsos has conducted exit polls at every UK General Election since 1997. An exit poll is distinct from the prediction polls published during the election campaign.', 'It intercepts voters as they leave polling stations and asks them to complete a mock ballot paper. Ipsos positions its teams at more than 130 polling stations across Great Britain to deliver a detailed and high-quality picture of voting trends, informing an accurate seat projection.', 'Typically, prediction polls project vote share and seats by surveying people on their voting intentions. However, these are approximations based on respondents’ accuracy in predicting their behavior and various statistical choices.', 'The exit poll, on the other hand, is based on the actual behavior of voters coming out of 100-150 selected polling stations. Ipsos fieldworkers tally voters and ask them to fill out replicas of secret ballots, which are later examined for vote changes throughout the day. This method provides a more accurate prediction as it reflects actual behavior rather than intentions.', 'Historically, the exit poll has been very accurate. In 2019, it was off by only three seats for the Conservatives. It slightly overestimated the Scottish National Party and Liberal Democrats, but the overall result closely matched the final outcome. In 2017, it missed by four seats for the main parties. In 2015, it correctly predicted the Conservatives’ unexpected victory, prompting an inquiry into the polling industry.', 'There have been notable errors, such as in 1992 when exit polls incorrectly predicted a hung parliament. However, it generally gives a good idea of the election outcome.', 'While the exit poll provides an early indication of the result, there’s always some uncertainty, especially in years with significant changes, like the 2024 election with its new electoral boundaries. The complexity of tracking vote changes across newly drawn constituencies adds to this uncertainty.', 'For those eager to know the results, it’s possible to watch the exit poll at 10pm, sleep, and wake up at 3am to see the progress. However, with the excitement of a historic election, staying up all night might be preferable to avoid missing out.']","July 05, 2024",https://www.geo.tv/latest/552661-why-exit-poll-is-a-critical-indicator-in-uks-election-process,World,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2024-07-05/552661_4847504_updates.jpg

"Reform UK's Pakistan origin leader denies racist, Islamophobic allegations against party","Karachi-born leader Ben Habib has bankrolled anti-immigration party, says ""he's proud of his Pakistani heritage""","['LONDON: Pakistan origin leader of the far-right Reform UK Ben Habib has denied that his party is full of racists, Islamophobes and extreme right-wing elements who hate Muslims, immigrants and people of ethnic minority origins.', 'Reform UK has surged in polls in recent weeks and could come second or third in vote shares on 4th of July as its ranks swell by voters who previously supported Conservatives but are now adrift.', ""The far-right party's joint deputy leader Habib spoke to Geo News in Northampton where he’s standing on the Reform UK ticket for July 4 elections."", 'He said: “I am the biggest example of what Reform UK is, I am proud of my Pakistani heritage, my father is a Pakistani and mum is English. I love my identity and I am one the leaders of Reform UK. It cannot be racist party. I reject the assertion that we are a far-right party.”', 'The multi-millionaire tycoon, whose full name is Benyamin Habib, has paid donations of tens of thousands to the right-wing Reform UK which opposes immigration to the UK, hates multi-culturalism and its leader Nigel Farage has openly spoken against Muslims. One of the party’s key leaders was caught last week racially abusing PM Rishi Sunak.', 'Habib came to the UK from Karachi around 50 years ago to study at a boarding school, dedicated to rich kids. His parents sent him to a private school in the UK to give him a better chance in life. He went into the property business after finishing his education and became a millionaire. He lives in London’s Fulham area and often visits Karachi to meet his friends and relatives.', 'He told Geo News: “We are not racists and Islamophobes. We are British citizens. We want to put the UK and its citizens first. We are not against immigrates but we are against the rampant immigration that we had over the last few decades. This has broken up our system, our NHS, housing and our job market. We want immigrations to be radically reduced. We want a culture where everyone lives harmoniously where everyone is equal, no matter whether you are from Pakistan, India or Africa.”', 'Far-right Tommy Robinson, Britain First, Patriotic Alternative and Homeland have urge their supporters to vote for Farage’s Reform Party.', 'The rise of Reform UK in the polls in recent days has dominated discussions in the media. It now looks certain that Reform’s leader Farage will win in the constituency of Clacton, whilst polling seems to indicate that the party could be on course to win several seats and it also looks certain that it will ensure that Tories lose many seats.', 'Habib defended his leader Farage and told Geo News that Farage had only spoken against the “extremist Muslims” and not the ordinary Muslims.', 'He said: “He is only against extremists. He thinks we have extremists in the country and he is concerned about them.”', 'He then added: “We have imported cheap, unskilled labour which has undermined wag growth and then we have high taxation. It has become impossible to earn a fair wage living. We have got six million people on benefits in this country – that is 20% of the workforce. The six million are on benefits because of low wages and high taxes, making it impossible to earn a reasonable net wage. Cheap imported labour is only one factor amongst others.”', 'Habib used to donate money to Conservatives but stopped giving them money because he thinks they are “broken and don’t stand up for the British values. They have broken this country for their lust of power. I cannot give money to such a party anymore”.', 'He also said that his father lives with him. When asked what his dad and Pakistani relatives ask him about supporting a right-wing party like Reform UK, he said that they kept asking him the same questions that Geo asked. “I give them the same answers. There is a lot of fake news about Reform UK. I am not a racist. I am proud of my Pakistani heritage and I am a proud British citizen”.', 'During his visits to Pakistan, he said that he saw the whole nation waving Pakistani flags on its national days. “It’s just one flag all over the country and people celebrate it. That’s brilliant. Why don’t we celebrate the Union Flag here, what are we ashamed of?', 'Moreover, he said that it was important to expose and end the Tory party.', 'Reform has been dogged by allegations over racism, misogyny, homophobia and support for Hitler and Putin but a recent poll has put them three points ahead of the Tories.', 'The Whitestone poll for Reach plc put Reform on 21%, the Tories on just 18% while Labour maintained a clear lead on 38%. According to Electoral Calculus in a general election this would leave the Conservatives on a mere 50 seats, give Reform 29 but the Lib Dems would be the official opposition with 74 seats.']","July 03, 2024",https://www.geo.tv/latest/552391-reform-uks-pakistan-origin-leader-denies-allegations-of-racist-islamophobic-against-party,World,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2024-07-03/552391_4115381_updates.jpg

Who will benefit the most from sugar exports?,It is estimated that PSMA could collectively earn around $90 million or nearly Rs25 billion from these exports,"['LAHORE: Following permission granted by the government, sugar mill owners have swiftly capitalised on high international prices, making quick bucks at the cost of other stakeholders including farmers and consumers, market insiders claimed here on Saturday.', 'Driven by multiple factors boosting international sugar prices, local manufacturers stand to earn billions through exports of 0.15 million tonnes. Deals have reportedly been struck at prices ranging from $580 to as high as $610-$630 per tonne for various export destinations. Industry insiders anticipate the quick utilisation of the allotted export quota, with mill owners lobbying for further export permissions.', 'It is estimated that members of the Pakistan Sugar Mills Association (PSMA) could collectively earn around $90 million or nearly Rs25 billion from these exports, surpassing the $105 million recorded in 2023. If additional export permissions are granted, export values may even exceed the $223 million achieved in 2019.', 'While foreign exchange earnings are welcomed, concerns persist that sugar exports could disrupt the domestic supply chain. India, facing similar concerns, has maintained a ban on sugar exports despite bullish sentiments in the international market.', 'A senior official expressed concerns over lifting the ban on sugar exports, adding that exports should not have been allowed at all as this could create a shortfall in the country leading to price hikes. “Sugar’s is a perception-driven market. Despite tall claims by the sugar industry, there are chances that the price will escalate,” he warned.', 'According to him, the middlemen have started purchasing sugar in anticipation of a price surge in the future.', 'Senior PSMA member Muhammad Waheed Chaudhary held a different view of the commodity market situation. To a question about sugar exports, he said that trade should absolutely be allowed saying there should be no ban on the export of sugar at least until the next crushing season. At least 0.75-1 million tonnes of sugar should be allowed to export, he insisted.', 'Sugar is being sold below the cost of production in the domestic market, causing huge losses to the mills, he observed. Without timely permission for sugar exports, mills could face difficulty in paying the farmers’ dues. This factor may adversely affect sugarcane cultivation. This loss may translate into lower sugar production, necessitating sugar imports next year.', 'He emphasised that if the government continues to make decisions based on economics, Pakistan can be a member of the sugar export market like neighbouring India, creating a win-win situation for farmers and manufacturers.', 'Waheed Ch argued that if the government wanted to keep the price of sugar low by imposing a ban on the export of commodity, why did it allow the export of rice, vegetables, fruit and other goods without taking into account their domestic prices?', 'According to a report, global sugar prices have surged to a three-month high this year after a relatively flat trend until April 2024, driven by concerns over the reduced supply from India, the world’s second-largest sugar producer. India kept export restrictions in place to ensure sufficient domestic supplies as food inflation remained one of the highest drivers of price growth in the country, reducing availability in export markets.', 'Additionally, the report adds, below-average monsoon rains have negatively impacted Indian sugar production, with a reported 1.6% decline from October to April and more mills closing earlier than the previous year.', 'India extended restrictions on sugar exports from October 31, 2023 until further notice to maintain adequate domestic supplies. Moreover, in Thailand, record heat and below-average rainfall have resulted in the lowest sugarcane yield in 13 years, pushing global sugar prices higher.', 'Originally published in The News']","July 07, 2024",https://www.geo.tv/latest/553024-who-will-benefit-the-most-from-sugar-exports,Business,https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2024-07-07/553024_5789409_updates.jpg
